The Transfer Learning part of the notebook was done in Sagemaker.

Files/Folders: 

app_test : External data used for testing

Plots : Plots in report.md

dog_app.ipynb : file with fully functional code, all code cells executed and displaying output, and all questions answered.

PS:

I asked a mentor as you advised and it seems that the project I was doing had a rubric before and I had to meet the rubric in the main submit page too.
